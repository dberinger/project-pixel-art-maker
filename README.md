Project Pixel Art Maker
## Description
Project Pixel Art Maker is a little app in HTML, CSS and jQuery. It uses a table as canvas, custom dimensions, as specified by the user.
## Installation

## Usage
To start drawing a canvas needs to be created. Dimensions, in squares, are set by the user and can be adjusted in real-time using one of the four adjustment buttons. Resubmitting dimensions once a drawing is present will erase it. Canvas can also be cleared without changing its size by using the 'Clear' button. The are no restrictions regarding the choice of the drawing color. User can draw using single clicks or continuously.
## Notes
If canvas was resized to zero using adjustment buttons, then a column ("+ COL") has to be created before a row to start rebuilding it.
